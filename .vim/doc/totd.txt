*totd.txt*	Display a vim tip when starting vim.

Purpose:
=======

     You can download a file of tips on using vim.  The totd.vim plugin
will give you a "Tip of the Day" by opening this file in a help window, once a
day, when you start vim.  The plugin keeps track of the tips it has displayed,
and runs through them in order.  You can also get a tip whenever you want one
with the command						*:TipOfTheDay*
>
	:TipOfTheDay

The usual abbreviation rules apply, so :Tip will probably work just as well.

tip, configure how often to show tips, ...) or suggest an improvement to the

Installation:						*totd-installation*
============

1. Unpack totd.zip into a directory in your |runtimepath|.  For most users,
this typically means ~/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles or $VIM/vimfiles .  This will
create files
	plugin/totd.vim	(the plugin)
	doc/totd.txt	(this file)
	plugin/vimtips/vimtips.txt	(skeleton tips file)

2a. The easiest thing may be to restart vim, either right now or whenever you
get around to it.  Then totd.vim will automatically run |:helptags|, edit the
tags file, and open the skeleton vimtips file.

2b. If you want to finish the installation right now, without restarting vim,
simply source the totd.vim file and get a tip:
>
	:source path/to/totd.vim
	:TipOfTheDay

3. The totd.vim plugin will open the skeleton vimtips file in a help window.
Follow the URL there to download a real vimtips file.

What not to do:
==============

     Since vimtips.txt is not formatted as a vim help file, you do not want to
run |:helptags| on any directory containing it.  This is why it is put in its
own directory, plugin/vimtips/ .  If you have already done this, simply move
vimtips.txt out of the doc/ directory and run |:helptags| again.
